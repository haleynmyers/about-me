# Haley Myers Student Page

## Description 
This site contains three pages: About Me, Portfolio, and Contact. It is to be used as an introduction to me personally and professionally. 
The About Me page includes a breief biography and picture on the About Me page, which serves as the homepage and landing page.
The Portfolio contains a collection of screenshot from pages I have created as well as a few placeholders for future projects. As my portfolio expands, I will link a GitHub Page to the corresponding screen shot which will redirect the user to the page in its entirety.
The Contact page provides a form for the user to submit in order to contact me.

## Installation
This page can be accessed by the user via a direct link from my GitHub Pages. This repository is set to public so it may also be cloned directly to your local device.

## Usage 
The three page can be accessed via the navigation bar located at the top of each page.
