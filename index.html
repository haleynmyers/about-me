                        I was born in Jackson, Mississippi, and moved to Nashville, Tennessee shortly after
                        graduating from The University of Southern Mississippi in 2010. All through high school and college I worked
                        at a local coffee shop, which is where I met me husband. We moved to Nashville purely out of a
                        desire to live somewhere new and busy and exciting.
                        <br /><br />
                        Our son was born in 2016, and I decided to leave my job at a preschool to stay home with
                        him. Working at a preschool was supposed to be a temporary job while we got settled in Nashville
                        and learned our way around, but I found a great commmunity there and stayed about five years.
                        During my time at home with my son, I have had time to really focus on what type of career I should
                        pursue.
                        <br /><br />
                        In my free time I love reading, especially fantasy series, gardening and learning more about
                        the plants and vegetables I grow (There is always something more to learn!), and exploring
                        Nashville's parks and greenways with my family. I have taught myself numerous crafts such as sewing,
                        cross-stitching, stained-glass making, painting, home DIY projects, and design. I believe my
                        artisitic eye and creative problem-solving will pave the way for a career in wev
                        development. I enrolled in Coding Boot Camp so that I can put my natural gifts to work in a challenging and
                        intellectually fulfilling environment.
